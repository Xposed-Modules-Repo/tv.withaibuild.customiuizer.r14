An Xposed module for customizing the system UI and interactions on
**HyperOS 1 / Android 14**.

This repository is the LSPosed module listing and download page. Source code, the complete
changelog, build instructions, and engineering documentation are maintained in the
[source repository](https://github.com/tomthenpc/customiuizer-a14).

User-visible changes are listed in this repository's
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/tv.withaibuild.customiuizer.r14/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
The source repository remains authoritative for complete engineering records.

## Supported Environment

- HyperOS 1 / Android 14 (SDK 34)
- `arm64-v8a`
- A framework implementing modern libxposed API 101 or API 102
- Module package: `tv.withaibuild.customiuizer.r14`

Android 15, Android 16, and other MIUI/HyperOS versions are not supported. Do not enable this
module together with upstream or another CustoMIUIzer-derived module.

## Feature Overview

- Status-bar icons, battery, signal, network speed, date, and temperature;
- Control center, volume panel, brightness, and notification behavior;
- Lock screen, charging information, media UI, and shortcuts;
- Launcher, recents, folders, icons, and home-screen gestures;
- Navigation bar, buttons, custom actions, power menu, and system animations;
- App, permission, installer, sharing, privacy-app, and app-lock behavior.

Feature availability depends on the device ROM and system-app versions.

## r14.12.0 Highlights

- One APK supports libxposed API 101 and 102: API 101 is the minimum runtime baseline, while API
  102 is the compile target.
- Core hooks, settings UI, and utilities completed a conservative Kotlin migration.
- SystemUI recreation no longer causes duplicate hooks, receivers, observers, coroutines, or
  animation tasks in the reviewed paths.
- Frequent drawing and hook callbacks perform fewer repeated reflection operations, resource
  lookups, formatting operations, and temporary allocations.
- Disabled features avoid registering unnecessary hooks and long-lived listeners where possible.
- The Release build passed R8, resource shrinking, zipalign, and APK v2 signing checks.

## Differences in This Maintenance Build

- `MonwF/customiuizer@v24.10.12` is used only as the Android 14 functional reference; this is not
  an official upstream release.
- The module uses an independent package, version line, signing identity, and release process, so
  it does not replace the upstream installation identity.
- Maintenance is limited to HyperOS 1 / Android 14; Android 15/16 compatibility is not mixed into
  this release line.
- It uses modern libxposed API 101/102 and does not depend on the Legacy Xposed Hook API.
- Long-lived system processes receive focused lifecycle, duplicate-registration, hot-path, and
  disabled-feature overhead controls.

## Performance and Power Note

Compared with earlier implementations, this release reduces unnecessary hooks, duplicate
listeners, orphaned background tasks, hot-path allocations, and exception retries. In theory,
this can lower the module's additional CPU, memory, and wakeup overhead in SystemUI, Launcher,
and `system_server`.

Actual gains depend on enabled features, ROM, and usage. No fixed battery, CPU, or memory
improvement percentage is claimed without a same-device controlled comparison.

## Installation

1. Download and install the APK from the
   [r14.12.0 Release](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/tv.withaibuild.customiuizer.r14/releases/tag/174-r14.12.0).
2. Enable the module in LSPosed/Vector and confirm the recommended scope.
3. Open module settings once.
4. Fully reboot the device.

An API 101 manager may warn that `targetApiVersion=102` targets a newer API. The warning alone does
not mean loading failed; use target-process logs and actual behavior as the source of truth.
